  HEA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "This is the 'Kingdom of Roses' that I rule.\nThe 810 laws established by the great Queen of Hearts are absolute, and anyone who dares disobey them will, without exception, find their head forfeit.\nUnder the leadership of Housewarden Riddle Rosehearts, the disciplined and rigorous Heartslabyul dorm now demonstrates its power as an independent state. The students, as 'Card Soldiers,' boast flawless coordination and execute any mission to perfection. White roses that have not been painted red, tea not brewed precisely on time—such things are not permitted to exist here. Everything must be perfect, just as the Queen's rules dictate.\nTheir discipline fosters stable governance and high productivity in domestic affairs, but such overly strict rule can sometimes breed discontent. However, to Housewarden Riddle, this is a trivial matter.\nFor he is the rules, and he is absolute."

  HEA_instilling_fear_desc: "It seems the freshmen have yet to understand the severity of Heartslabyul. I must drill into them the greatness of the Queen of Hearts and the terror of breaking the rules. Fear is, after all, the most effective form of education."
  HEA_obedience_training_desc: "After an education in fear, the next step is to cultivate absolute obedience. Through the training program I have devised, I will raise soldiers who can act instantly on any command without question. They do not need to think. All they need is to follow my rules."
  HEA_obedience_desc: "The training has reached its final stage. The students have cast aside their individual wills and become mere pawns to execute my orders. Their complete obedience will make my nation unshakeable."
  HEA_classroom_learning_tutoring_desc: "No matter how much magic or physical strength one has, without knowledge, one cannot be perfect. I shall order Trey to conduct remedial lessons to improve the students' academic abilities. A diligent spirit is the foundation of development in all fields."
  HEA_magic_tutoring_increased_firepower_desc: "One cannot win by only defending. To crush the enemy, overwhelming firepower is necessary. I will have Cater lead research and training in more powerful and destructive offensive magic. Anyone who stands in my way will be erased without a trace."

  HEA_develop_poland_desc: "I hear the people of Poland are stubborn and difficult to handle. In that case, I shall have them engage in the munitions industry. Hard labor should be the most effective education for them."
  HEA_develop_romania_desc: "The same goes for Romania's oil fields. Their inefficient management is a waste of a treasure. I will intervene directly and convert every last drop into power for my nation."

That would be me.\n\nI value the rules set by the Queen of Hearts above all else, and I mercilessly punish those who break them with my Unique Magic, §R'Off with Your Head!'§!. This magic completely seals the target's own magic—a power unique to me.\n\nOthers say I have an 'overly serious personality and can be hysterical at times,' but this is the result of the strict upbringing by my mother, a magical physician. However, at its core lies a strong sense of responsibility to care for the dorm and maintain order above all else. I am the most just and powerful being in this country."
  
  heartslabyul.20.t: "Vice-Housewarden: Trey Clover"
  heartslabyul.20.d: "The Vice-Housewarden of Heartslabyul, §RTrey Clover§!.\nWith his gentle and sensible personality, he is admired by the students as a sort of parental figure.

His hobby is posting on 'Magicam,' and he is the mood-maker who always brightens the atmosphere.\nHowever, behind his lighthearted demeanor lies a sharp sense of observation that allows him to calmly assess situations. His Unique Magic, §R'Split Card'§!, is a powerful ability that creates clones. In intelligence gathering and diversionary tactics, his abilities will be of immeasurable value."

  heartslabyul.40.t: "First-Year: Ace Trappola"
  heartslabyul.40.d: "Heartslabyul's troublemaker number one, §RAce Trappola§!.\nHe's got a knack for getting by and a slightly mischievous personality, a repeat offender who constantly breaks my rules and gets his head collared. However, he is good at reading the room and has a surprisingly considerate side for his friends. In a pinch, his quick wit and initiative might prove useful... though that's a rare occasion."
  
  heartslabyul.50.t: "First-Year: Deuce Spade"
  heartslabyul.50.d: "Heartslabyul's troublemaker number two, §RDeuce Spade§!.\nHe strives to be a model student, but his past as a delinquent occasionally surfaces, leading him to take rash actions. He is fundamentally very serious and honest, but he is also terribly stubborn and inflexible.\nHis Unique Magic, §R'Bet the Limit'§!, is a counter-magic that returns an attack he receives directly back to the opponent. It is a simple, and therefore, powerful ability."

This is an extremely important rule!\nAn excuse like 'it's just one sugar cube' is unacceptable. A rule is a rule. If even one is broken, the entire order will collapse.

I lost track of time...'\n'After that, Mother became even stricter, tying me down. My free time completely vanished, and I was locked up so I couldn't leave the house on my own.'\n'If you break the rules, even your fun time gets taken away.
